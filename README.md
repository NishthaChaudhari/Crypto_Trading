# Blockhouse Crypto Work Trial Submission

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set environment variables for API keys and AWS credentials.
4. Run Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`.
5. Open `crypto_work_trial.ipynb` and execute cells sequentially.
6. For Task 5, update `s3_bucket` in the pipeline cell.
7. Notes:
   - Public data (Tasks 1, 4, 5) works without keys.
   - Trading (Tasks 2, 3) requires API keys with permissions.
   - Use testnet for safety.
